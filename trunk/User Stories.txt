Server Settings: As a developer I want to set which server CCMenu monitors so that I can see information relevant to me.

Exclude project from menu: As a developer I want to specify which projects should be excluded from the display in the 
menu.

Growl notifications: As a developer I want CCMenu to notify me of relevant events via Growl so that I am aware of all 
relevant status changes without having to switch applications.

-- release 1 ?

Selectable columns: As a developer I want to configure which columns are visible in the project window so that I can see 
the information that is most relevant to me.

Absolute build time format: As a developer I want to set the format in which the last build times are displayed so that 
I can see relevant information in the format that suits me best.

Build timing in menu: As a developer I want to see build timing, that is remaining time for this build (as a negative 
number) or time by which current build exceeds last build (as a positive number), in the menu so that I know how long I
have to wait before checking in or that the build might be stuck.

Publish notification if current build time exceeds last build time by x: As a developer I want CCMenu to notify me (via 
Growl) if the current build time exceeds the last build time by a margin that I can configure so that I am alerted as 
soon as possible about a build that might be stuck.

Multi server/column for server: As a developer I want CCMenu to monitor multiple CC servers, and show CC server name 
alongside project name, so that I can see all projects that I am working on in one CCMenu instance.
